Running the Seerpod 
====================================
It depends on MySQL, you need to set up MySQL and the database schema for the demo to run.


1. Install prerequisites and build tornado

   See http://www.tornadoweb.org/ for installation instructions. If you can
   run the "helloworld" example application, your environment is set up
   correctly.

2. Install MySQL if needed

   Consult the documentation for your platform. Under Ubuntu Linux you
   can run "apt-get install mysql". Under OS X you can download the
   MySQL PKG file from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

3. Install Python prerequisites

   Install the packages MySQL-python, torndb, and markdown (e.g. using pip or
   easy_install). Note that these packages currently only work on
   Python 2. Tornado supports Python 3, but this seerpod demo does not.

3. Connect to MySQL and create a database and user for the seerpod.

   Connect to MySQL as a user that can create databases and users:
   mysql -u root

   Create a database named "seerpod":
   mysql> CREATE DATABASE seerpod;

   Allow the "seerpod" user to connect with the password "seerpod":
   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON seerpod.* TO 'seerpod'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'seerpod';
  
   Set this export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mysql/lib/


4. Create the tables in your new database.

   You can use the provided schema.sql file by running this command:
   mysql --user=seerpod --password=Datadr1ven --database=seerpod < schema.sql

   You can run the above command again later if you want to delete the
   contents of the seerpod and start over after testing.

5. Run the seerpod example

   With the default user, password, and database you can just run:
   ./seerpod.py
 
   visit the site at localhost:8888
